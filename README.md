FMKeystoneBundle
================

A Symfony2 implementation of the [OpenStack Identity Service API](http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/).

You can use this bundle to add a token-baed authentication mechanism for a REST API. The token is send using a HTTP header.

More information about the protocol can be found here: http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-identity-service/2.0/

## Notes
This bundle is a work in progress and does not cover the _complete_ OpenStack Indentity Service API spec. While we are pretty confident about the quality of this implementation thus far, we are not experts in this field. Use at your own risk!

## Acknowledgements
A lot of components are heavily inspired by [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle).
